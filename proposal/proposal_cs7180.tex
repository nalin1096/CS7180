% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
  We might see how denoising algorithms perform under different lighting
  conditions. We're very interested in solving a problem with practical
  applications. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Most likely want to reference ideas from this paper if we're
sticking with denoising \cite{tian2018deep}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item describe what is the problem you want to solve
  \item provide examples where solving your problem is highly valuable 
  \item cite other papers that have tried to solve a similar problem
    (use google scholar to search)
  \item explain why the solutions from existing papers are still not enough
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposed Idea}

\begin{itemize}
\item describe your idea to solve the problem
\item explain the novelty of your idea, compared with other papers
\item what datasets/baselines are you going to use
\item how do you measure success
\end{itemize}

\textit{``...we highly encourage bold and original ideas.''}
