# CS 7180 Spring 2019 Project

This repo contains our group project for [Special Topics in AI: Deep Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/cs-7180-spring-2019/home) taught by Professor [Qi (Rose) Yu](http://roseyu.com/)
in Spring 2019. Our project builds off the [Learning to See in the Dark](http://cchen156.web.engr.illinois.edu/SID.html) paper by Chen et. al. (2018). Their paper introduces an end-to-end
deep learning model which converts a picture taken in the dark to one the is taken in ideal
lighting conditions.
